This README file explains how to use the programs for CS2400 
Fall 2018 Project 1. 

----RUN IN AN IDE----
To run the programs in an IDE, such as Eclipse, the contents of
the TeraEsver_p1 zip file can be copied into a project and ran. 
BagInterface.java is for Task 1 and is implemented by PileOfBooks.java (Task 2)
as well as PileOfBooksNodes.java (Task 3). PileOfBooks.java is tested in the
driver program called ArrayDriver.java. PileOfBooksNodes.java is tested in the
LinkedDriver.java file. Note: The time complexity analysis is also part of the
zip file and is named Esver_Proj1_TimeComplexity.
